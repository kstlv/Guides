# Pocket Import Helper â€” Import URL list into Pocket

This program will help you make a file ready for import into [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) from your text file with links (URLs).

The reason for creating this tool: I have not found a solution to import a simple list of links into Pocket.

## How to Use

0. Compile using `Visual Studio Code` ([guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/dotnet)) or `Visual Studio` ([guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-console?view=vs-2022)) or `JetBrains Rider`.
1. Create a `links.txt` file next to the program executable file (program folder).
2. Fill in this file with the links (URLs) following the requirements. File requirements: URLs must start with `http://` or with `https://`, each line is a separate URL, blank lines will be ignored.
3. Run the executable file of the program and follow the instructions in the console.
4. Import the `links.html` (located in the program folder) into Pocket: https://getpocket.com/import/instapaper (make sure you are signed in to your Pocket account).
