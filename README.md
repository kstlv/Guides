# Pocket Import Helper â€” Import URL list into Pocket

This program will help you make a file ready for import into [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) from your text file with links (URLs).

The reason for creating this tool: I have not found a solution to import a simple list of links into Pocket.

## How to use

0. Compile using `Visual Studio Code` or `Visual Studio`.
1. Create a `links.txt` file next to the program executable file.
2. Fill in this file with the links (URLs) following the requirements. File requirements: URLs must start with `http://` or with `https://`, each line is a separate URL, blank lines will be ignored.
3. Run the executable file of the program and follow the instructions in the console.
4. Import the `links.html` into Pocket: https://getpocket.com/import/instapaper (make sure you are signed in to your Pocket account).
